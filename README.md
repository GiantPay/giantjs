**giantjs** is a development environment and testing framework for Giant Contracts.
With **giantjs**, you get:

* Built-in smart contract compilation, linking and deployment management.
* Automated contract testing with Mocha and Chai.
* Configurable build pipeline with support for custom build processes.
* Scriptable deployment & migrations framework.
* Network management for deploying to many public & private networks.
* Interactive console for direct contract communication.
* Instant rebuilding of assets during development.
* External script runner that executes scripts within a **giantjs** environment.

### Install

```
$ npm install -g giantjs
```

### Quick Usage

For a default set of contracts and tests, run the following within an empty project directory:

```
$ giantjs init
```

From there, you can run `giantjs compile`, `giantjs migrate` and `giantjs test` to compile your contracts, deploy those contracts to the network, and run their associated unit tests.

**giantjs** comes bundled with a local development blockchain server that launches automatically when you invoke the commands above.
